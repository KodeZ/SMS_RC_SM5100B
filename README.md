SMS_RC_SM5100B
==============

An application that will receive commands and send SMS responses. Can be a base for an SMS interface towards SM5100B.

The SM5100B might be moved out as a separate library if there are requests for that, for now, this is how I turn on and off the heating at my cabin.

I have put this under GPL. Get in touch if you have issues with that.

Good luck
